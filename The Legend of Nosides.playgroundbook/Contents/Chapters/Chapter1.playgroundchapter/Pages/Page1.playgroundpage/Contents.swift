 ### Chapter 1: The National Birth
 
 Every year in Euclidea, 1000 shapes are born from the center of the city. They are the light of Euclidea's society, the lifeblood, the heart.
 
 It takes a powerful touch from above in order to free them from their perpetual motion.
 
 However, one year, after all of the shapes were freed, there laid one lone shape in the middle: a shape born with no sides.
